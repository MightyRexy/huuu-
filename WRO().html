            What Is WRO About
        </h2>
        <p>
            WRO (World Robot Olympiad) is an international robotics competition where students design, build and program robots to complete<br> specific challenges.It encourages creativity problem-solving, and teamwork while prmoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,<br> and Mathematics) education.<br><br>One of the key benefits of WRO is that it enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students<br> must anaylze challenges, experiment with different solutions, and refine their designs through trail and error. Additionally, WRO<br> promotes teamwork, as participants work in groups to strategize and optimize their robot's performance.<br><br>Beyond technical skills, WRO prepares students for future careers in engineering, AI, and automation. By applying coding and robicts<br>knowledge in a competitive setting, students gain hands-on experience that can lead to their future opportunities. Ultimately, robotics<br>competitions inspire young minds to pursue careers in science and technology, shaping the innovative of tomorrow.
